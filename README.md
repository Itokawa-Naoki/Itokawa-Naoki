 Hi! I’m Itokawa Naoki(糸川直樹), a post doctoral fellow at the Institute of Medical Science, the University of Tokyo.
I obtained my M.D from Chiba university school of medicine in 2015. After graduation, I worked as a medical doctor for 2 years in the National Hospital Organization Disaster Medical Center. During that time, I saw a lot of patient suffering from incurable diseases and felt that more basic understanding about biology are needed to develop a better approach for incurable diseases. I then entered doctoral course in the laboratory of Prof. Iwama in 2017.
 During doctoral course, I studied changes of chromatin accessibility and histone modification with aging of hematopoietic stem cells. I am currently working on bioinformatics using next-generation sequencing. I believe that research that utilizes bioinformatics, which has never been handled before, will lead to new medical discoveries.
